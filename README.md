## Preliminary Analysis
Based on the analysis, we can draw some preliminary insights about the Q2 2022 performance of Amazon India:

The total revenue for Q2 2022 decreased by -18.77% from April to June, with May revenue experiencing a -9.06% decrease from April, and June revenue seeing a -10.68% decrease from May, which is a cause of concern.

The revenue is dominated by the product category "Set," which accounts for 49.88% of total revenue, followed by kurta with 27.09% and Western Dress with 14.28%.

The top 5 product categories by average price in dollars are Set ($9.43), Saree (\$9.14), Western Dress ($8.75), Ethnic Dress (\$8.26), and Top ($6.09), indicating that these products are high-value orders.

The total number of cancelled and returned orders was 49,178, which represents 17.53% of all orders. Of these, 14.22% were cancelled and 1.64% were returned.

The average order amount by customer type is $8.21 for business customers and \$7.37 for regular customers.

The most popular product category varies by state, and it may be worthwhile to analyze the reasons behind these trends and invest in marketing campaigns or promotions accordingly.

## Analysis Summary and Recommendations
Use promotions to drive interest in the Western Dress product by targeting the top 50% of states ranked by sales revenue since their revenue is between 10 and 100 times more than the top ranked states by revenue in the lower 50%.
